# Divvy HW For Mobile Software Engineer Position

Hello there! Here is the repo for the homework assignment. I had initially wanted to do a bunch of fancy stuff with react-native-renanimated2, but I opted to focus on:

- Creating one customizable Line Graph and use it in 3 different situations.
- Ability to add any number of data sets AND chart options to configure options like color.
- Interacting with the graph through JavaScript to native iOS.
- Updating the UI via native iOS chart interaction to JavaScript state.

I look forward to hearing from you all!
